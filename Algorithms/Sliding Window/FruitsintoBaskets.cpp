/** Problem Statement
  * Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
  * you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket.
  * The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
  *
  * You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree.
  * You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
  * Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
  *
  * Example 1:
  * Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
  * Output: 3
  * Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
  *
  * Example 2:
  * Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
  * Output: 5
  * Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket.
  * This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
